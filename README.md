BRAMD
=====

Simple Demo illustrating a BackboneJS + RequireJS + AMD architecture.  

This is a demo that was designed for FireFox to avoid a local server.

To use this demo on other browsers, consult documentation of your browser to see how to temporarily disable same-origin policy.

If you don't want to re-configure your browser nor install a local server, you can get away with running a client-side proxy (e.g. Fiddler, Charles) to mock a local server.
